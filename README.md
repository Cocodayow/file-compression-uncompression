#File Compression
The compress program will take as input an arbitrary file (original_file) and will use Huffman Compression to create a compressed version of the file (compressed_file)

#File Uncompression
The uncompress program will then take as input a compressed file created by your compress program (compressed_file) and will uncompress the file (uncompressed_file)
